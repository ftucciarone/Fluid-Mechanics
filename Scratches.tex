\begin{definition}[Partition]\label{def:Partition}
    Let $A$ be a set. A collection of sets $\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathscr{P}\rbkt{A}$ is a \emph{partition}\index{Partition} of $A$ if distinct members of $\mathcal{F}$ are disjoint and $A$ can be expressed as the union of the sets in $\mathcal{F}$.
\end{definition}

\section{measure on semi-rings}
measure can be defined on semi-rings. Semi-rings are good because they are semi-open intervals (or rectangles) in $\R$ (or $\R^{n}$). But measures here are just finite additive.

To get to $\sigma-$additivity (i.e. to go into rings equipped with a measure) you need topology. 
\section{external measure}
Covering? Maybe with the partition
Infimum of all the possible coverings that one can build
External measure is monotonic
triangle inequality $\abs{m\rbkt{A}-m\rbkt{B}}\leq\abs{m\rbkt{A\Delta B}}$
